My name is Owen Wertzberger, and I'm a programming student from Pennsylvania.

I'm interested in open-source projects, mostly

Here you'll find documentation of my journey learning to use technology to
express myself and solve problems. This blog was made **by** humans, **for**
humans. Thank you for visiting!
