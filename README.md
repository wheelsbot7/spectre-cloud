Spectre is a terminal-inspired theme for Astro, built using TypeScript and
Astro.

I've adapted it for my own personal use. It currently houses a blog, a project
showcase, and a personal biography/linktree. This site is still being updated,
so let me know if you spot something wrong over in the Issues tab.
